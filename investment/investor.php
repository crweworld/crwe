						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 1: Register as an Investor</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">The first step is to register. It is free and takes just a minute. Select your own investment criteria so that you only receive proposals that would be of interest to you. You will be sent an email to confirm you email address. Your membership will then need to be approved by our staff before you can log in. You will be notified via email once your account has been activated.</p>
						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 2: Notification</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">Once registered you will receive proposals via email that match your investment criteria. The proposals contain answers to specific questions that investors need to know in order to understand important aspects of the business and decide if you should contact the entrepreneur to learn more.</p>
						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 3: Review Proposals</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">You can log in and review investment proposals in the system as often as you like and even look at ones that are outside your investment criteria. We offer tools that allow you to actively manage your list of investment proposals by deleting, and saving proposals.</p>	
						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 4: Make Contact</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">Once you find a proposal of interest, you can send a contact request to the entrepreneur by logging in. Please be aware that we are an match-making service only. We receive no commissions and do not become involved in any due-dilligence, negotiations, or deal structuring between you and the entrepreneur.</p>
