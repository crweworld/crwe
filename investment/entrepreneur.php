						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 1: Register as an Entrepreneur</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">The first step in reaching investors through our Investment Network is to register. This involves answering a few questions about yourself in our one page registration form. It is free to register and the process only takes a few minutes. What are you waiting for? <a href="/dashboard">Register here</a>.</p>
						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 2: Create A Proposal</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">Once you have registered, you can then login and create an investment proposal. We don't ask you for a detailed business plan, only that you answer questions that investors need to know in order to do initial due diligence on your idea and your business. When you are ready to activate your proposal, a staff member will do a final review prior to releasing the proposal to investors.</p>	
						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 3: Find Matching Investors</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">Once your proposal is approved, our system will cross reference your proposal information with investor preferences to determine which investors should be notified about your proposal.</p>	
						<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Step 4: Make Contact</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">Once your proposal is distributed to investors, you will be notified if an investor is interested in your proposal. Please be aware that we are a match-making service only. We receive no commissions so our rates for helping you find investors can remain low. Our system gives you access to contact information of interested investors, however, we do not become involved in due diligence, negotiations, or deal structuring between you and any interested investors.</p>
