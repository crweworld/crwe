<h2>Enrollment</h2>
To enroll in the affiliate program, you must submit an affiliate application and be approved. Applications are  processed within 24 hours and applicants will be notified of their acceptance status as soon as possible after  their information is reviewed. <br />

Affiliates will receive 50% on selected services of the revenue as a commission from orders placed (unless  noted otherwise for a particular product). Commissions may change at the discretion of the services provider.  Commissions may increase during limited time special promotions, but they will return thereafter to the  regular commission rate. <br />

For a sale to generate a commission to an Affiliate, the customer must complete order and remit with full  payment for the product ordered through the secure order system. Word of mouth referrals will not result in  an affiliate commission being generated. Commissions will only be paid on sales that are made when the  customer clicks through qualified, correctly structured Affiliate link. Using the properly coded links is the sole  responsibility of the affiliate.  <br />

Please note that CRWE WORLD reserves the right to suspend payment of Commission at any time and  indefinitely, if it suspects fraud or other improper activity or a potential breach of any of the terms in this  Agreement by the Affiliate or a Customer(s).
